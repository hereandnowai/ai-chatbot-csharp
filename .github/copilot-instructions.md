## Project Summary

Successfully created an AI-powered chatbot using C# with the following features:

- **OpenAI Integration**: Connects to OpenAI's GPT models for intelligent responses
- **Mock AI Fallback**: Built-in mock AI service when OpenAI is not configured
- **Clean Architecture**: Uses dependency injection, configuration management, and structured logging
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Colorful console interface with thinking animations
- **Configurable**: Easy to customize via appsettings.json
- **Extensible**: Well-structured code for easy feature additions

## How to Use

1. **Quick Start (Mock Mode)**: Run `dotnet run` to start with built-in AI responses
2. **OpenAI Mode**: Add your OpenAI API key to `appsettings.json` and run
3. **VS Code**: Use the "Run AI ChatBot" task from the command palette

## Files Created

- `Program.cs` - Application entry point with dependency injection setup
- `Services/IAIService.cs` - AI service interface
- `Services/OpenAIService.cs` - OpenAI API integration
- `Services/MockAIService.cs` - Local AI simulation
- `Services/ChatBotService.cs` - Main chatbot conversation logic
- `appsettings.json` - Configuration file
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - VS Code task configuration

The project is ready to use and can be easily extended with additional AI services or features!
